This interpreter was written by Adam Michael and Dan Hanson in the spring of 2014 for CSSE304.

This interpreter is only compatible with Petite Chez Scheme. It will not work with Racket.

To start the interpreter, open an interpreter and enter the following:

(load "main.ss")
(repl)

This will open a new window, the scheme interpreter.

I am most proud of this interpreter for the extensive use of Y and Y* combinators in the parsing of letrec expressions.
