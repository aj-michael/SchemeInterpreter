This interpreter was written by Adam Michael and Dan Hanson in the spring of 2014 for CSSE304.

This interpreter is only compatible with Petite Chez Scheme. It will not work with Racket.

I am most proud of this interpreter for the extensive use of Y and Y* combinators in the parsing of letrec expressions.
